#The data in this graph shows a semi normal distribution with a slight skew to the right. The years 2009, 2010, and 2011 had the highest counts of purple urchins. I do think graph reflects changes in the purple urchin graph. I think in the years after 2012 the number of urchins decreases and then stays at a steady rate. I would have to run a p-test before discovering if the data is significant. There are a number of factors that can explain the decrease including temperature warming, increased pollution, less food, or lack of gestation habitats.
